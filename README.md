# spidertrons-manager
The Spidertron Manager mod enhances your gameplay by allowing you to control multiple groups of Spidertrons with ease. A group of Spidertrons consists of several Spidertrons that share the same name, enabling you to organize and manage them efficiently.

One of the key features of this mod is its ability to differentiate between surfaces. This means you can assign specific Spidertron groups to operate on designated surfaces, optimizing their functionality and improving your overall strategy.
